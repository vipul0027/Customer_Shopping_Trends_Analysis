# 📊 Customer Shopping Trends & Behavior Analysis

This repository showcases an end-to-end data analytics project focused on understanding retail customer behavior. The project involves data extraction using *PostgreSQL, data exploration via **Python, and interactive storytelling through **Power BI*.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to analyze customer purchasing patterns, identify high-value segments, and derive actionable insights to drive business growth.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- *SQL (PostgreSQL):* For data modeling and performing complex business logic queries.
- *Power BI:* To create a dynamic and interactive dashboard for stakeholders.
- *Python (Pandas/Jupyter):* Used for initial data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

## 🔍 Key Business Questions Solved (SQL)
Using advanced PostgreSQL queries, I addressed several critical business problems:
